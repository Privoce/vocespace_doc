## Check your own Linux architecture

VoceSpace contains two images:
- amd: `privoce/vocespace:latest`
- arm: `privoce/vocespace:latest_arm`

So you need to know your current server architecture to make a choice

### 1. Use the `uname` command

The `uname` command can display the system's kernel information, including the hardware architecture.

Run the following command:
```bash
uname -m
```

- If the output is `x86_64`, it means the system is based on the AMD64 or Intel64 architecture (commonly known as x86_64).
- If the output is `aarch64` or `arm64`, it means the system is based on the ARM64 architecture.
- If the output is `armv7l` or something similar, it means the system is based on the ARMv7 architecture.

### 2. Use the `arch` command
The `arch` command can also display the system's architecture type.

Run the following command:
```bash
arch
```

- If the output is `x86_64`, it means the system is based on AMD64 or Intel64 architecture.
- If the output is `aarch64` or `arm64`, it means the system is based on ARM64 architecture.
- If the output is `armv7l` or similar, it means the system is based on ARMv7 architecture.

## Docker network connection timeout


### 👍 Choose to use the Chinese domestic mirror

#### AMD64

```bash
docker pull crpi-0u8xaje6k9g42uky.cn-hangzhou.personal.cr.aliyuncs.com/vocespace/vocespace:latest
```

#### ARM64

```bash
docker pull crpi-0u8xaje6k9g42uky.cn-hangzhou.personal.cr.aliyuncs.com/vocespace/vocespace:latest_arm
```

### Configure Docker

Domestic users may encounter the problem of Docker Hub access connection timeout, please configure it according to the following content.

#### Create daemon.json

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/docker
sudo touch /etc/docker/daemon.json
```

#### Add repository mirror

- Tencent: `https://mirror.ccs.tencentyun.com`
- HKUST: `https://docker.mirrors.ustc.edu.cn`
- Alibaba: See Console -> Search -> ACR -> Image Tool -> Image Acceleration

```bash
sudo tee /etc/docker/daemon.json <<-'EOF'
{
"registry-mirrors": ["https://mirror.ccs.tencentyun.com", "https://docker.mirrors.ustc.edu.cn"]
}
EOF
```

#### Restart docker

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

### Change server

In China, even if the server has a public IP, it may not be able to smoothly access external network services such as Docker Hub and GitHub. This is mainly due to the complexity of the network environment and the restrictions of relevant policies. The following are possible reasons and solutions:
Common reasons

- DNS resolution problem: The default DNS server may not correctly resolve the domain name of Docker Hub or GitHub

- Network restrictions: Some network environments (such as operator networks, corporate intranets) may restrict or block access to specific external network services

- Firewall or security policy: The server's firewall or security group rules may block access to specific services

- GFW impact: In China, some external network services may be restricted by GFW

## Common Docker instructions

### View images

```bash
docker image ls
# Or use
docker images
```

### View all containers

```bash
docker ps -a
```

### View running containers

```bash
docker ps
```

### Shut down the container

```bash
docker stop container_name_or_id
```

### Kill the container (force shutdown)

```bash
docker kill container_name_or_id
```

### Delete the container

```bash
docker rm container_name_or_id

# Delete the stopped container
docker container prune
# Delete all, including running ones
docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)
```

### Delete the image

```bash
docker rmi image_name_or_id

# Delete all
docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)
```
